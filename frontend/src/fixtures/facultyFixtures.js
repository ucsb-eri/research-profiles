    expertise: "Sarah Rosalena explores the intersection of traditional handicraft traditions with emerging technology, focusing on the integration of Indigenous cosmologies with digital tools.",
    research_description: "Sarah Rosalenaâ€™s research navigates the dynamic interplay between traditional handicraft and contemporary digital technologies. Her work is deeply rooted in Indigenous cosmologies, which she reinterprets through the lens of modern computational tools. By weaving together materials and techniques ranging from hand-dyed natural colors to 3D ceramic printing, Rosalena creates innovative artworks that challenge conventional boundaries between high and low technology, the human and the nonhuman, and the ancient and the futuristic.",
